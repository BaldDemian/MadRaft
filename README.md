# MadRaft

[![CI](https://github.com/madsys-dev/madraft/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/madsys-dev/madraft/actions)

The labs of Raft consensus algorithm based on [MadSim](https://github.com/madsys-dev/madsim).

Some codes are derived from [MIT 6.824](http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2021/) and [PingCAP Talent Plan: Raft Lab](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/tree/master/courses/dss/raft).

## Key Features

* **Deterministic simulation**: Catch a rare bug and then reproduce it at any time you want. 
* **Discrete event simulation**: No time wasted on sleep. The full test can be completed in a few seconds.
* **Async**: The code is written in a fully async-style.
